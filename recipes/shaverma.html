    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of my signature recipes that will be very familiar to all my friends because I make this so often.
         It’s off the charts for effort vs output: just a handful of everyday spices, garlic, a splash of lemon and 
         olive oil transforms into the most incredible flavour.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>lemon juice</li>
<li>Chicken</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>spices</li>
<li>spice control</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
<li> <strong>Mix marinade:</strong> For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a ziplock bag. A bag works 
    best because the chicken remains nicely coated in the marinade. If you prefer to use a container, either turn the 
    chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.</li>
<li><strong>Add chicken into the marinade.</strong> Seal the bag, removing excess air, then massage to coat from the outside. Leave 
    to marinade for 12 to 24 hours in the fridge. If you’re pressed for time, even 3 hours will do!</li>
<li><strong>yogurt sauce –</strong>Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes to let the 
    flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.</li>
<li><strong>cook chicken</strong>either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will get a great crust on it from the spices, and you will adore 
    the smell. It’s intoxicating!</li>
<li><strong>rest</strong>Cchicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, else they will just run 
    out everywhere when you slice the meat.</li>
<li><strong>to serve</strong> serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make their own wraps! The chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce
     and warmed flatbreads – homemade or store bought. If the chicken is on the larger side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are smaller, I tend 
     to just leave them whole.</li>
    </ol>
